QA Challenges


## Challenge 1

Using the Selenium test framework, create a test framework for an application that will meet the following requirements:
* The framework should use the page object model
* The framework should be simple to understand, and easy to modify/update
* The framework should appropriately handle waiting and other timing issues
* Please document any assumptions you are making about how to find elements of the application
* Demonstrate the usage of your framework by writing at least 3 end-to-end tests using the framework
* Be prepared to explain the details of your framework and answer any questions we may have about it

### Bonus Points
* Create a library or suite of tools that can be used to debug failing tests
* Demonstrate how your framework can be used to write tests that run concurrently
* Make your framework capable of testing an application across multiple platforms (Android and iOS)
* Write your framework in such a way that it can test internationalization or localization of the app
* Write your framework such that it can be used for load or performance testing the app


### The Application
Please design your framework to test an application based on one of the following designs:
- https://github.com/Hart-Challenge/iOS_Code_Challenge
- https://github.com/Hart-Challenge/codechallenge_android

## Challenge 2

Establish a method of ensuring correct processing of data in Apache Spark and Kafka based framework.

The Goal of this framework should be an automation framework that achieves the following:

Establish Environment Readiness on Deployment
Verify Data is existing and displaying / poll-able correctly

Pick any dataset(s) off of here for the challenge. https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets

How do you verify if data has been properly converted in a stream like XML to json?

How do you normalize and verify fields of nested data?
How do you verify output?

Please be as specific as possible in your strategy document.  Include expected timelines and deliverables if possible.  This document should demonstrate:
Your ability to recognize the most important QA tasks in a project
Your ability to prioritize and organize an overwhelming amount of work
Your ability to research, evaluate, and recommend appropriate tools
Your ability to learn and understand new technologies in order to do a job

Your strategy should clearly explain the following:
What needs to be done today
What Testing strategies need to be built in cooperation with the developers
What tools and code bases are required to succeed

## Challenge 3

Design an automated testing strategy for the product defined here:
https://github.com/Hart-Challenge/codechallenge_java_mq

The automation strategy should include the following:
* A plan for how the product can be tested without connecting to production servers
* Details of how the functionality of the product would be tested and validated
* Code demonstrating how the product will be tested
* At least three sample tests using the above code
